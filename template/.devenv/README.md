# Setup your development environment

1. Ensure you have renamed the template folder to your project name.
2. Run the **setupdev** script (bat for Windows, sh for POSIX) from the project root.
   - If you have a GitHub repo, pass it as an argument:
     ```
     .devenv/setupdev.sh https://github.com/my-org/my-repo.git
     ```
   - This will automatically set everything up and push a new empty main branch + init branch.

#### The setup process will:
- Install Go dev and build requirements (golangci-lint, commitlint, goimports).
- Prepare basic configurations for VSCode (the .vscode folder).
- Create a pre-commit hook for source code analysis with golangci-lint.
- Create a commit-msg hook for enforcing commit conventions with CommitLint.
- Initialize a Go module with the Checkmarx One SDK as a dependency.
